                Reflective design connects users to deeper meaning, identity, and values. This section

                The following values guide our design decisions, ensuring alignment between CCI's mission 
                and the needs of older adults seeking community connection. Each value connects directly 
                to specific design implementations across the website.

                    problems or deficits. Together, they create a consistent message: this is an active, vibrant 
                    community where older people support each other and build meaningful relationships.

                    <h3>Changes Made and Rationale</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"elderly seniors" → "older adults":</strong> Uses preferred, respectful terminology per Australian Style Manual</li>
                        <li><strong>"combat loneliness" → "building meaningful connections":</strong> Shifts from deficit-focused (problem) to asset-focused (solution); more empowering</li>
                        <li><strong>"providing them" → "supports...in":</strong> Changes from paternalistic language to collaborative partnership language</li>
                        <li><strong>"aged people often struggle with technology" → "people of all technology experience levels":</strong> Removes ageist assumption and stereotype; acknowledges diversity of experience</li>
                        <li><strong>"made everything simple for them" → "designed an intuitive interface":</strong> Avoids condescending tone; "intuitive" is professional without being patronizing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Values reflected:</strong> Revised text reflects respect, empowerment, and belonging. 
                        It positions older adults as active participants rather than passive recipients, avoids stereotypes, 
                        and uses inclusive language that acknowledges diversity within the older adult community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>WCAG 3.1.1 compliance:</strong> Revised text uses clear, direct language with shorter 
                        sentences and fewer complex phrases, making it easier to understand for all users including 
                        those with cognitive disabilities.
