                Reflective design connects users to deeper meaning, identity, and values. This section 
                demonstrates how our design choices express the mission of Connecting Communities Initiative, 
                support user identity, and create lasting emotional resonance with the older adult community.

                The following values guide our design decisions, ensuring alignment between CCI's mission 
                and the needs of older adults seeking community connection. Each value connects directly 
                to specific design implementations across the website.

                    problems or deficits. Together, they create a consistent message: this is an active, vibrant 
                    community where older people support each other and build meaningful relationships.

                <p>
                    Displaying real community members creates immediate belonging. Users see themselves 
                    reflected—not through stock photos or marketing personas, but through actual people 
                    who've taken the step to join. This authenticity builds trust and validates the 
                    community's purpose.

                    The diversity of names, messages, and photos demonstrates that this space welcomes

                    Denisho, and Fligo all face in different ways.

                        <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Use plain English with clear sentence structure (WCAG 3.1.1); explain technical terms when necessary</li>
                        <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Maintain respectful, empowering language that treats users as capable adults</li>

                        and directly addresses the needs identified in A2: older adults want to be treated with 
                        respect and dignity, not patronized or stereotyped.

                    <h3>Changes Made and Rationale</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"elderly seniors" → "older adults":</strong> Uses preferred, respectful terminology per Australian Style Manual</li>
                        <li><strong>"combat loneliness" → "building meaningful connections":</strong> Shifts from deficit-focused (problem) to asset-focused (solution); more empowering</li>
                        <li><strong>"providing them" → "supports...in":</strong> Changes from paternalistic language to collaborative partnership language</li>
                        <li><strong>"aged people often struggle with technology" → "people of all technology experience levels":</strong> Removes ageist assumption and stereotype; acknowledges diversity of experience</li>
                        <li><strong>"made everything simple for them" → "designed an intuitive interface":</strong> Avoids condescending tone; "intuitive" is professional without being patronizing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Values reflected:</strong> Revised text reflects respect, empowerment, and belonging. 
                        It positions older adults as active participants rather than passive recipients, avoids stereotypes, 
                        and uses inclusive language that acknowledges diversity within the older adult community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>WCAG 3.1.1 compliance:</strong> Revised text uses clear, direct language with shorter 
                        sentences and fewer complex phrases, making it easier to understand for all users including 
                        those with cognitive disabilities.

            <h2>Accessibility Audit Report</h2>
            <p>
                This audit of the Behavioural Design page was conducted using IBM Equal Access Accessibility 
                Checker to identify WCAG 2.2 compliance issues. The scan revealed items requiring review and 
                potential violations. This report addresses the three most significant findings and outlines 
                remediation plans for final implementation.

            <div class="audit-issue">
                <h3>Issue 1: Heading Structure Verification</h3>
                <div class="audit-details">
                    <p><strong>WCAG Success Criterion:</strong> 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)</p>
                    <p><strong>Checker Status:</strong> Flagged for review</p>
                    <p><strong>Element Affected:</strong> Page heading hierarchy structure</p>
                    <p><strong>Issue Description:</strong> Accessibility checker flagged potential heading level 
                    skip. However, manual review confirms proper semantic structure: h1 (page title "Behavioural Design") 
                    → h2 (section headings like "Navigation Components," "Icon Set") → h3 (subsection headings like 
                    "Desktop Navigation," "Core Icon Collection"). This follows correct hierarchical nesting.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact on Users:</strong> If heading hierarchy were actually skipped, screen reader users 
                    would experience confusion navigating page structure. Proper heading hierarchy (which is present) 
                    allows users to understand content organization and jump between sections efficiently using assistive 
                    technology navigation shortcuts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> This appears to be a false positive or checker limitation in 
                    distinguishing navigation elements from main content headings. No code changes needed. Will verify 
                    with secondary accessibility testing tools (WAVE, axe DevTools) and manual screen reader testing 
                    to confirm compliance. If confirmed as false positive, will document in final implementation notes.</p>

            <div class="audit-issue">
                <h3>Issue 2: Icon Button Descriptive Labels</h3>
                <div class="audit-details">
                    <p><strong>WCAG Success Criterion:</strong> 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A) and 2.4.6 
                    Headings and Labels (Level AA)</p>
                    <p><strong>Element Affected:</strong> Icon-only buttons in button demonstration section (line 304-314)</p>
                    <p><strong>Issue Description:</strong> Icon buttons include aria-label attributes but could be 
                    more descriptive for demonstration purposes. Current labels identify function ("Settings") but 
                    don't clarify this is a size demonstration showing 36px, 48px, and 60px variations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact on Users:</strong> Screen reader users hear "Settings button" three times 
                    consecutively without understanding these demonstrate different sizing options. While technically 
                    accessible (buttons are labeled), the context for this style guide demonstration isn't clear. 
                    For Akasha from our user research, her granddaughter Emma helping her wouldn't understand why 
                    three identical-sounding buttons appear in sequence.</p>
                    <p><strong>Proposed Fix:</strong> Enhance aria-labels to include size context:
                    <code>&lt;button class="btn btn-icon" aria-label="Settings button - small size (36 pixels)"&gt;</code>,
                    <code>aria-label="Settings button - medium size (48 pixels)"</code>,
                    <code>aria-label="Settings button - large size (60 pixels)"</code>. 
                    This maintains accessibility while clarifying the demonstration purpose.</p>

                <h3>Issue 3: File Input Additional Context</h3>
                <div class="audit-details">
                    <p><strong>WCAG Success Criterion:</strong> 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)</p>
                    <p><strong>Element Affected:</strong> Profile photo file upload input (line 378-382)</p>
                    <p><strong>Issue Description:</strong> File input has proper label association (for="image" / id="image") 
                    meeting basic accessibility requirements. However, it lacks supplementary instructions about acceptable 
                    file types and size limits that would benefit users with cognitive disabilities or limited technical 
                    experience.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact on Users:</strong> While technically compliant, users like Akasha (67, limited 
                    tech literacy) would benefit from explicit guidance: "What file types can I upload? Is my phone photo 
                    too big?" Without instructions, users may attempt invalid uploads, experience confusing error messages, 
                    or abandon the form entirely. Enhanced instructions reduce cognitive load and prevent user frustration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Proposed Fix:</strong> Add aria-describedby with supplementary help text:
                    <pre><code>&lt;label for="image"&gt;Profile Photo (optional)&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;input type="file" id="image" name="image" 
                        accept="image/*" aria-describedby="image-help"&gt;
                    &lt;span id="image-help" class="form-help"&gt;
                    Accepted formats: JPG, PNG, GIF. Maximum size: 5MB
                    &lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
                    This provides clear expectations without changing the required label association.</p>

                <h3>Commitment to Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    This audit demonstrates that our current implementation meets baseline WCAG Level A requirements, 
                    with opportunities to enhance usability through more descriptive labeling and instructional text. 
                    The flagged issues range from false positives (heading hierarchy) to enhancement opportunities 
                    (more descriptive button labels and form instructions).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our user research with Akasha, Denisho, and Fligo revealed that accessibility isn't just about 
                    technical compliance—it's about dignity, independence, and safety. Enhanced labels help Akasha 
                    use technology with less family assistance. Clear instructions reduce anxiety for users like 
                    Denisho who need efficient, private access. Proper semantic structure supports Fligo's need 
                    for quick, discreet navigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All identified improvements will be implemented in final production, with follow-up testing using 
                    multiple tools (WAVE, axe DevTools) and manual screen reader verification (NVDA, JAWS) to ensure 
                    WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance across all interactive components.
