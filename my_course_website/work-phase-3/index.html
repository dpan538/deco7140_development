                    A comprehensive style guide demonstrating design decisions across visceral,

                <h2>About This Proposal</h2>
                <p>
                    This design proposal presents a complete style guide for a community platform supporting 
                    the Connecting Communities Initiative (CCI). The design responds to extensive user research 
                    and applies Norman's three levels of design—visceral, behavioural, and reflective—to create 
                    an accessible, inclusive, and meaningful digital experience.
                </p>
                <p class="m-t-2">
                    The style guide documents design decisions through practical demonstrations of visual systems, 
                    interactive components, and values-driven design choices. Each section includes rationale 
                    grounded in user needs, accessibility standards, and ethical considerations.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Design Approach Section -->
            <section class="m-y-4">
                <h2>Design Approach</h2>
                
                <p>
                    This proposal demonstrates user-centered design methodology, beginning with research-based 
                    understanding of community needs and concluding with concrete implementation decisions. 
                    The approach prioritizes accessibility, privacy, and cultural sensitivity while maintaining 
                    visual appeal and functional effectiveness.
                </p>

                <p class="m-t-2">
                    Design decisions are documented with clear rationale connecting user research findings to 
                    specific implementation choices. Accessibility considerations are integrated throughout 
                    rather than treated as compliance checkboxes. Ethical implications are examined openly, 
                    acknowledging tensions between organizational goals and user protection.
                </p>

            <!-- Key Principles Section -->
            <section class="m-y-4">
                <h2>Core Design Principles</h2>
                
                <div class="style-section m-t-3">
                    <h3>Research-Grounded Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every design decision traces back to user research findings. Visual choices, interaction 
                        patterns, and content strategies respond to documented user needs rather than designer 
                        preferences or aesthetic trends. This ensures the platform serves actual community members 
                        rather than idealized personas.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="style-section">
                    <h3>Accessibility as Foundation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Accessibility considerations inform design from the beginning rather than being added 
                        retroactively. WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance is baseline; design goes beyond minimum 
                        standards to support users with diverse abilities, technology comfort levels, and 
                        situational constraints.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="style-section">
                    <h3>Privacy as Safety</h3>
                    <p>
                        Privacy features protect users facing discrimination, surveillance, or vulnerability. 
                        Design choices prioritize user safety over data collection convenience, recognizing that 
                        trust-building serves long-term organizational goals better than aggressive analytics.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="style-section">
                    <h3>Inclusive Visual Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        Visual and verbal design avoids stereotypes, represents diverse experiences, and respects 
                        how people describe themselves. Language follows inclusive terminology standards; imagery 
                        shows genuine interaction rather than stock photo aesthetics.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    This design proposal demonstrates competency across technical implementation, accessibility 
                    standards, ethical reasoning, and critical thinking. The style guide provides practical 
                    documentation suitable for developer handoff while explaining design rationale for client 
                    understanding.
