                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>This design proposal presents a comprehensive wellness community platform focused on mental health support. Based on extensive user research including interviews with Akasha (elderly gardening enthusiast seeking mental wellbeing), Denisho (young professional facing workplace discrimination), and Fligo (transgender teacher seeking support), this design emphasizes accessibility, inclusivity, and emotional safety.</p>
                    
                    <p class="m-t-2">The platform aims to connect diverse community members while respecting their unique needs for privacy, cultural sensitivity, and varying levels of technological comfort. All design decisions prioritize user wellbeing and foster meaningful connections within the wellness community.</p>

                <h2 class="m-b-2">Key Design Principles</h2>
                
                <div>
                    <h3>Accessibility First</h3>
                    <p>Every design decision considers users with varying technological comfort levels, from Akasha who prefers simple interfaces to younger users who expect modern functionality. We prioritize clear navigation, readable text, and intuitive interactions.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Cultural Sensitivity</h3>
                    <p>Drawing from Denisho's multicultural background and need for workplace discretion, our design accommodates diverse cultural perspectives and provides flexible privacy controls that respect individual comfort levels.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Emotional Safety</h3>
                    <p>Inspired by Fligo's concerns about safety and support, the platform prioritizes creating a psychologically safe environment through careful color choices, supportive language, and robust privacy protections.</p>
