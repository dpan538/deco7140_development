            <!-- Interview 1: Akasha -->
        <section class="interview">
            <h3 class="user-name">Akasha</h3>
            <p class="initial-prompt">67-year-old gardening enthusiast suffering from insomnia and memory confusion. She is looking for a psychotherapy platform for residents with limited literacy who could get help from their grandchildren to alleviate her loneliness.</p>
            
            <p class="question">What do you usually use to go online - your phone, computer, or something else?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>Well, I don't really go online much myself. My granddaughter Emma has to help me. She has one of those little phones - a smartphone I think? But the buttons are so tiny and the words are so small. When she shows me things on it, I can't read them very well.</p>
                <p>Emma set up this tablet for me - it's bigger, which helps with my eyes. But honestly, I get confused about where to touch and what happens when I do. Sometimes I touch the wrong thing and everything disappears, and then I don't know how to get back. That's why I usually wait for Emma to visit on weekends. She's very patient with me, but I feel bad always asking for help.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">How do you like to connect with people who get what you're going through?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>Oh, that's hard, dear. I used to have my gardening club - we'd meet every Tuesday at the community center. Those ladies understood what it's like to have trouble sleeping and forgetting things. We'd share our worries over tea and cookies.</p>
                <p>But since the pandemic, many of us stopped meeting. Some moved to be closer to family, others... well, some passed on. Now I mostly talk to my neighbor Mrs. Chen over the fence when I'm working in my garden. She has insomnia too, and we both worry about being a burden on our families.</p>
                <p>My granddaughter tries to help. She showed me some "chat groups" on her phone for people with sleep problems, but the typing is too fast for me to follow. People use strange short words I don't understand. And they stay up all night talking - that's not helping anyone sleep!</p>
                <p>What I really miss is sitting face-to-face with someone who understands. Someone who won't judge me when I forget what I was saying halfway through, or when I tell the same story twice. I want to feel useful too, not just someone who needs help all the time. In my garden club, I could share my knowledge about growing vegetables. Now I feel like I only take and never give.</p>
                <p>I wish there was a way to connect with people like me, but in a slower way. Maybe where my granddaughter could help me write messages, or where we could talk with our voices instead of typing?</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">What would make you feel safe opening up about personal stuff on a website?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>Oh my, that's scary to think about. I'm not sure I would feel safe at all, to be honest. You hear such terrible stories about people on the internet stealing your information or tricking elderly people.</p>
                <p>I would need my granddaughter to check everything first. She's smart about these things - she could read all the fine print and make sure it's not one of those scams. I can't read those tiny legal words anyway.</p>
                <p>I think I would only feel comfortable if it was recommended by my doctor. If Dr. Martinez said it was safe, then I might try it. Or maybe if other people from my church were using it too - people I actually know and trust.</p>
                <p>The writing part worries me a lot. My handwriting isn't very good anymore, and typing is so slow for me. What if I make mistakes and people think I'm stupid? What if I accidentally share something I didn't mean to? Emma showed me once how you can "delete" things, but how do I know it's really gone?</p>
                <p>I would want everything to be very simple. No passwords I have to remember - I already forget where I put my glasses! Maybe something where Emma could help me set it up once, and then I could just talk instead of typing?</p>
                <p>And I would never, ever want my real name or address on there. There are bad people who look for lonely old ladies to take advantage of. But I also wouldn't want to pretend to be someone I'm not - that doesn't feel right either.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, I'd want to know that someone kind is watching over the conversations, making sure people are being respectful and not mean to each other.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">Have you ever tried to find wellness resources that work for both you and family members? How did that go?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>Oh yes, we tried that with my daughter Sarah - that's Emma's mother. She's been having a hard time since her divorce, feeling very sad and stressed. We thought maybe we could find something to help both of us.</p>
                <p>Sarah found this website about meditation and relaxation. She printed out some pages for me because I can't read them on the computer screen very well. But the instructions were so complicated! They used words I didn't understand, and they wanted us to sit in strange positions that hurt my back.</p>
                <p>Then Sarah tried to show me some videos on her laptop. The people talked so fast, and there was music that made me feel anxious instead of calm. Sarah got frustrated because she said it was helping her, but I couldn't follow along. I felt like I was holding her back.</p>
                <p>My doctor gave me some pamphlets about sleep problems, which I could read just fine. But when I showed them to Sarah, she said they were "too basic" and "old-fashioned." She wanted something more modern and interactive.</p>
                <p>The problem is we need different things. I need big print, simple words, and time to go slowly. Sarah needs things that fit into her busy schedule and work on her phone. We ended up giving up on finding something together.</p>
                <p>I think it would be wonderful if there was something that could work for both generations - maybe where the same information could be presented in different ways? Like I could get a printed version or have someone read it to me, while Sarah could use her phone? That way we could still support each other even if we're using it differently.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">When you're using websites or apps, what features help you the most?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>Oh dear, I need so much help with these computer things. The most important thing is big, big letters. I can't see those tiny words anymore - my eyes aren't what they used to be. Emma has to make everything bigger for me, but then sometimes the words get cut off the screen.</p>
                <p>I need things to be very slow and patient with me. If something disappears or changes too quickly, I get confused and don't know what happened. Sometimes Emma clicks on things and they move so fast I can't follow what she's doing.</p>
                <p>Pictures help me a lot more than words. If there's a little picture of a telephone next to a phone number, I understand that better than just seeing numbers. Same with buttons - if it has a picture of what it does, that's much easier for me.</p>
                <p>I really, really need someone to help me. I can't do these things by myself. So anything that makes it easier for Emma to help me would be wonderful. Maybe where she could set things up for me first, or where we could both look at the screen together?</p>
                <p>And please, no sounds that suddenly start playing! That frightens me. I like quiet.</p>
                <p>I also need things to stay the same. When Emma shows me how to do something, and then the next week everything looks different, I have to learn all over again. That's very hard for my memory.</p>
                <p>Most of all, I need it to be forgiving when I make mistakes. I'm going to touch the wrong things sometimes, and I don't want everything to break or disappear when I do that.</p>

        <!-- Interview 2: Denisho -->
        <section class="interview">
            <h3 class="user-name">Denisho</h3>
            <p class="initial-prompt">56-year-old man navigating complex family dynamics with his Buddhist wife and adopted son, while facing workplace discrimination and seeking help to strengthen family relationships across different cultural and religious backgrounds.</p>
            
            <p class="question">What do you usually use to go online - your phone, computer, or something else?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>I use my work laptop mostly, when I'm home in the evenings. I have a smartphone, but I'm not as comfortable with it as my wife or son are. At work, I'm careful about what I search for - I don't want my IT department or supervisors seeing that I'm looking up things about workplace discrimination or family counseling. That feels too personal and risky given my current situation there.</p>
                <p>My wife uses her tablet a lot, especially for connecting with her Buddhist community online. She's shown me some resources, but they're often in Chinese or focused on Buddhist perspectives, which I respect but don't always connect with as a Christian.</p>
                <p>I tend to do most of my searching late at night when everyone's asleep. It feels more private that way, though I know that's probably not the healthiest approach.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">How do you like to connect with people who get what you're going through?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>That's been one of the most isolating parts of this whole situation. I feel like I'm caught between multiple worlds and don't fully belong in any of them.</p>
                <p>I tried going to my church's men's group, but when I brought up the challenges we're facing as a multicultural family, I got some... uncomfortable responses. Some well-meaning but ignorant comments about "mixing cultures" and assumptions about my son that I won't repeat. I stopped going.</p>
                <p>Online forums have been hit or miss. I found a few adoption support groups, but most focus on younger parents or don't address the racial dynamics we're dealing with. There's one interfaith marriage forum that's been somewhat helpful, but even there, adding adoption and workplace discrimination into the mix makes our situation feel pretty unique.</p>
                <p>The most helpful connections have actually been through my son's school counselor, who connected me with two other dads in similar situations. We meet for coffee sometimes - just informal conversations. There's something powerful about talking face-to-face with someone who understands both the joys and the specific challenges of raising a child who doesn't look like you in a world that makes assumptions.</p>
                <p>I wish there was a space online where I could connect with other men dealing with complex family dynamics without having to worry about judgment from people who've never walked in these shoes. Somewhere that recognized that families come in all configurations and that workplace stress can spill over into family life in destructive ways.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">What would make you feel safe opening up about personal stuff on a website?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>Privacy is absolutely critical for me. Given my workplace situation, I cannot afford to have any of this traced back to me professionally. I'd need complete anonymity - no real names, no location details, nothing that could identify me or my family.</p>
                <p>I'd want to understand exactly how the platform protects user data. Is it encrypted? Who has access? How long is information stored? I work in finance, so I understand data security - I'd need to see real technical safeguards, not just promises.</p>
                <p>Moderation would be essential. I've seen too many online spaces devolve into political arguments or become echo chambers for hate. I'd need to know that there are clear community guidelines and active moderators who understand the complexity of multicultural families and workplace discrimination.</p>
                <p>I'd probably want to observe for a long time before participating. Maybe read other people's stories for weeks or months to get a feel for the community culture. I'd need to see that people are genuinely supportive and not just there to push their own agendas.</p>
                <p>The biggest thing is that I'd need assurance that this couldn't come back to hurt my family. My son doesn't need additional scrutiny at school, my wife doesn't need workplace complications, and I certainly can't afford to give my supervisors any more ammunition against me.</p>
                <p>I'd also want the option to delete everything if needed. Sometimes situations change, and what felt safe to share one day might feel risky later.</p>
                <p>Honestly, the safest I'd feel is if the platform was endorsed by professionals I trust - maybe family therapists or organizations that specifically work with multicultural families.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">Have you ever tried to find wellness resources that work for both you and family members? How did that go?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>That's been incredibly challenging. We tried family counseling about a year ago, but finding someone who understood all the layers of our situation was nearly impossible.</p>
                <p>The first therapist we saw was well-meaning but kept trying to address our issues as separate problems - the adoption challenges, the interfaith marriage, the workplace stress - instead of seeing how they all interconnected. My wife felt like her Buddhist perspective wasn't being respected, and I felt like the racial dynamics my son faces weren't being properly understood.</p>
                <p>We found some online resources about multicultural families, but most were either too academic or focused on much younger couples just starting out. The adoption resources were helpful to a point, but didn't address the specific challenges of raising a Black child when neither parent shares that lived experience.</p>
                <p>My wife found some Buddhist-based family harmony resources that helped her, but when I tried to engage with them from my Christian perspective, it felt forced. Similarly, the Christian family resources I found didn't really know how to handle our interfaith dynamic.</p>
                <p>The breakthrough came when we found a family therapist who specialized in multicultural adoptive families. But even then, we had to work hard to help her understand the workplace component - how the stress and discrimination I face at work affects my ability to be present for my family.</p>
                <p>What I learned is that we needed resources that could hold space for complexity rather than trying to fit us into predetermined categories. We needed something that recognized that our family's wellness couldn't be addressed by focusing on just one aspect of our identity or challenges.</p>
                <p>I think a platform that allowed families like ours to connect with others in similar situations, while also providing access to professionals who understand intersectional challenges, would be invaluable.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">When you're using websites or apps, what features help you the most?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>Security and privacy features are non-negotiable for me. I need to see clear information about encryption, data storage, and who has access to what I share. SSL certificates, privacy policies written in plain English, not legal jargon - these things matter when your livelihood could be at stake.</p>
                <p>Search functionality that's actually sophisticated. I need to be able to filter by specific combinations of issues - not just "family problems" but "multicultural adoption AND workplace discrimination AND interfaith marriage." Most platforms treat these as separate topics when they're deeply interconnected for people like me.</p>
                <p>Professional verification matters. If someone claims to be a therapist or counselor, I want to see credentials. I've wasted too much time getting advice from well-meaning people who had no real expertise in complex family dynamics.</p>
                <p>Anonymous messaging or private consultation options. Sometimes I need to ask a specific question without posting it publicly, even in a supportive community. The ability to reach out privately to a professional or experienced community member would be valuable.</p>
                <p>Content that acknowledges complexity rather than offering simple solutions. I'm immediately suspicious of resources that promise "5 easy steps" to fix multicultural family challenges. Real life is messier than that.</p>
                <p>Mobile accessibility is important because I often do my searching late at night when I can't sleep, usually on my phone so I don't wake anyone up. But the content needs to be substantial enough to be useful - not just feel-good platitudes.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, I need to be able to save and organize information for later reference. When I find something useful, I want to be able to come back to it without having to remember exactly where I found it.</p>

        <!-- Interview 3: Fligo -->
        <section class="interview">
            <h3 class="user-name">Fligo</h3>
            <p class="initial-prompt">21-year-old transgender woman who is a teacher, dealing with family pressure and discrimination while seeking psychological support and considering major life changes.</p>
            
            <p class="question">What do you usually use to go online - your phone, computer, or something else?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>Definitely my phone most of the time. I have to be really careful about privacy since I still live at home, so I do a lot of my searching in private browsing mode. I use my laptop sometimes when I'm at work during breaks, but I have to be super cautious there too - teaching can be... complicated when you're trans, especially in more conservative areas.</p>
                <p>I've got a few different browsers and apps set up with VPNs because I need to research things like legal name changes, hormone therapy follow-ups, and LGBTQ-friendly therapists without that showing up in anyone else's search history. My family still checks my devices sometimes, which is invasive but that's the reality I'm dealing with right now.</p>
                <p>Social media is tricky too. I have separate accounts - one that my family and colleagues can see, and private ones where I can actually be myself and connect with other trans people. It's exhausting maintaining multiple identities online, but it feels necessary for my safety right now.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">How do you like to connect with people who get what you're going through?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>Online communities have been a lifeline for me, honestly. I'm part of several trans support groups on Discord and Reddit where I can use my chosen name and pronouns without having to explain myself constantly. There's something powerful about connecting with other trans teachers specifically - we share strategies for navigating workplace challenges and supporting LGBTQ students safely.</p>
                <p>I also use apps like Lex and HER to connect with other LGBTQ people in my area, though I have to be careful about meeting people in person given my current living situation. Video calls through secure platforms have been really helpful - seeing other trans women who've been through similar experiences helps me feel less alone.</p>
                <p>The hardest part is finding spaces that understand the intersection of being trans AND dealing with family rejection. A lot of general LGBTQ spaces assume you have supportive family or are already living independently. Support groups specifically for people with unsupportive families are harder to find.</p>
                <p>I've connected with a few online mentors - older trans women who've been through the process of building new support systems after losing family connections. Their guidance about practical things like legal name changes, finding affirming healthcare, and building chosen family has been invaluable.</p>
                <p>What I really need is connection with people who understand the specific challenges of being a trans educator, dealing with family pressure, and planning for potential major life changes. The regular mental health forums don't really get the complexity of trans experiences, especially when you're in a precarious situation like mine.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">What would make you feel safe opening up about personal stuff on a website?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>Security is absolutely everything for me. I need end-to-end encryption, anonymous usernames, and zero tolerance for doxxing or sharing personal information. I've seen too many trans people get outed online and face real-world consequences - losing jobs, housing, family relationships. The platform would need robust reporting systems and immediate action against harassment.</p>
                <p>I'd want verification that moderators understand LGBTQ issues and trans experiences specifically. Too many general mental health platforms have moderators who don't recognize transphobic language or who treat our identities as "political topics" rather than lived experiences.</p>
                <p>The ability to use chosen names and pronouns consistently throughout the platform is non-negotiable. And I'd need assurance that my legal name would never be visible or required for participation - deadnaming can be incredibly triggering and dangerous.</p>
                <p>I'd want options for different levels of privacy within the platform. Sometimes I might want to share with the whole community, other times just with verified trans members, and sometimes I'd need completely private conversations with mental health professionals.</p>
                <p>Content warnings and trigger warnings are essential. Discussions about family rejection, medical procedures, discrimination, and mental health crises need to be clearly marked so people can engage when they're in the right headspace.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, I'd need to know that the platform has policies protecting users from conversion therapy advocates, TERFs, and other groups that actively harm trans people. I've been hurt before by joining "supportive" spaces that turned out to welcome people who fundamentally don't believe I should exist.</p>
                <p>Professional mental health support integration would be crucial - not just peer support, but access to trans-affirming therapists who understand the specific challenges we face.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">Have you ever tried to find wellness resources that work for both you and family members? How did that go?</p>
            <div class="response p-x-3">
                <p>That's been one of the most painful parts of this journey. I tried so hard to find resources that could help my family understand and accept me, but it backfired pretty badly.</p>
                <p>I found some PFLAG materials and websites for families of transgender people. I printed out some articles about supporting trans children and left them around the house, hoping my parents would read them. Instead, they got angry and said I was trying to "brainwash" them with "propaganda."</p>
                <p>I suggested family therapy, and we actually went to a few sessions. But the therapist wasn't educated about trans issues, and my parents used the sessions to talk about their "grief" over "losing their son" while I sat there having to defend my existence. It made things worse, not better.</p>
                <p>My fiancée tried to be supportive initially, but when I suggested couples counseling to work through her concerns about my transition, she said she didn't want to be "indoctrinated" and that she just needed me to "stop this phase." She found some online resources that were actually conversion therapy materials disguised as support, which was devastating.</p>
                <p>The reality is that you can't force people to be ready for resources that challenge their fundamental beliefs about gender. My family sees my identity as a mental illness or a choice, so any genuine support materials feel threatening to them.</p>
                <p>What I've learned is that I need to focus on resources for myself first - building my own support network and mental health foundation. The fantasy of finding something that would magically make my family accepting just isn't realistic. Now I'm focused on finding resources that help me navigate family rejection and build chosen family instead.</p>
                <p>It's heartbreaking, but sometimes self-preservation has to come first.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="question">When you're using websites or apps, what features help you the most?</p>

                <p>Privacy controls are absolutely critical. I need incognito browsing options, the ability to clear history instantly, and private messaging that doesn't leave traces on shared devices. Password protection for saved content is essential since my family still monitors my devices sometimes.</p>
                <p>Dark mode is a must - I do a lot of searching late at night when I can't sleep, and bright screens make everything worse. Plus it's less obvious when someone walks by that I'm actively using my phone.</p>
                <p>Quick exit features are really important. If I'm reading something sensitive and someone approaches, I need to be able to instantly switch to something innocuous or close everything without leaving traces in recently viewed items.</p>
                <p>Content filtering and trigger warnings help me manage my mental health. I can control when I'm ready to engage with heavy topics versus when I just need lighter community support. Being able to filter out discussions about family rejection or medical procedures when I'm having a bad day is crucial.</p>
                <p>Mobile-optimized everything, because that's how I access most resources. But I also need the ability to easily save or bookmark things to come back to later when I have more privacy or mental bandwidth.</p>
                <p>Anonymous or pseudonymous profiles with chosen name options. I never want to see my deadname anywhere on a platform, and I need the security of knowing other users can't trace back to my real identity.</p>
                <p>Crisis support features matter too - direct links to hotlines, immediate access to mental health professionals, and community members who are trained to recognize when someone needs urgent help.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, I need platforms that are designed by and for LGBTQ people, not general mental health sites trying to be "inclusive" as an afterthought. The difference in understanding is huge.</p>
