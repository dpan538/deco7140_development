            <h2>Technical Development</h2>
            <p>AI helped me create helper classes in components.css and fix color display problems in flip-card animations. 
                I used it to set up interactive highlight animations and fix text alignment issues. 
                The AI also helped me use !important declarations properly to override conflicting styles.</p>

            <p>File structure improvements were done with AI support, organizing sections, main containers, headers, and paragraphs for better HTML structure.</p>

            <h2>Content Creation and User Research</h2>
            <p>I used AI to generate interview personas and character records for user research. 
                All text content was written and corrected with AI assistance, including user stories, client needs analysis, accessibility assessments, and ethics analysis.</p>

            <p>AI helped me structure arguments and connect the ACS Code of Ethics to practical implementation.</p>

            <h2>Reflection and Learning</h2>
            <p>Using AI accelerated my study and development process and improved both technical and content quality. It was especially helpful for debugging CSS issues and creating realistic user personas.</p>

            <p>In this work phase, I paid more attention to AI outputs, checking that solutions worked for my specific needs and that content met course requirements. 
                I also learn to say no to some AI suggestions and ask for no improvements. AI served as a collaborative tool, I don't wanna just add more effects to an ugly structure.</p>

            <p>This taught me how to work effectively with AI while maintaining critical evaluation. 
                Not every suggestion was perfect, or even not right. 
                I am afraid of using AI. I think this work phase improved my research skills and understanding of user-centered design.</p>
