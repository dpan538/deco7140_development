                        <p>Newsletter management requiring technical skills could increase Akasha's dependence on her granddaughter, reducing her sense of independence.</p>

                <h3>Recommended Ethical Approach</h3>
                <p>Based on ACS principles and our user research, we recommend implementing a privacy-first newsletter system that prioritizes user safety, accessibility, and autonomy over data collection efficiency. This approach aligns with the "primacy of public interest" and "enhancement of quality of life" purposes while building sustainable community trust.</p>
                <p>The ethical framework demonstrates that protecting our most vulnerable users (elderly, discriminated workers, marginalized identities) ultimately creates a safer, more inclusive platform for all community members.</p>
